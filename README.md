# Timeout
Academic Project

## Description
For our 3rd year project we chose the following topic “Well-being as a measure of user-interface design (Time Out)”. We chose this as we both believe we can provide a solution to users dealing with current or future health issues due to prolonged screen usage. This directly correlates with our topic in user interface design.
